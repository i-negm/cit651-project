## Datasets
1. Test data we will drop -1 entries.

## Model Ideas
1. Multi-headed classifiers. (Multiple classifiers returning 0,1 -> the output can be combination from the output classifiers).
2. Concatenation of the labels into categories @Islam NEGM.

## Other Brain Storming Ideas

### Word Sequence vs. separate words

1. Best word ordering Classifiers -> Using CNN - Convotional Neural Networks. [1][2]
2. CNN vs. RNN? [2]
3. Understanding different techniques for text classicfications [3]

## Actions

1. Finalize the 3 remaining courses (basic, intermediate, NLP). @all
2. Research the text classification methods (at least top 5 methods), pros and cons. @all
